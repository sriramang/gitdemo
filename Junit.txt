Junit
1. Tt is a java library to perform unit testing.
2. When we divide application into small parts it is know as component or unit.
3. Type of testing which are conducted on these units are known as unit testing. 
4. Unit testing is performed by the developers.

LEVELS OF TESTING:
1. Unit testing.
2. Integration testing.
3. System testing.
4. Acceptance testing.

Testing:
It is a process in which we asses the quality of the software as per the user requirement.

Assertions in Junit:
1. It is a method in java through which we can verify the excepted and actual outputs.
2. There are multiple assert methods they are: 

	1. assertTrue(Boolean) - It Checks for true condition.
	2. assertFalse(Boolean) - It checks for false condition.
	3. assertEquals(Expected, result) - It asserts whether the two objects passed as arguments are equal.
	4. assertNull(object) - It asserts that an object is null.
	5. assertNotNull(Object) - It asserts that an object is not null.
	6. assertSame(expected, actual) - It assets that two object refers to the same.
 	7. assertNotSame(expected, actual) - It asserts that two object refers to different objects.

ex:

String s;
assertNull(s); //test case passed;
assertNotnull(s); // test case failed;


String s = "abcd";
String s1= s;
assertSame(s,s1);//test case passed;
assertNotSame(s,s1);//test case failed;


Annotations in Junit:

There are 6 annotations in junit:
	1. @Test - methods with @Test annotation are used to test a functionality. 
	2. @Before - methods with @Before annotation will run each and every test method.
	3. @After - methods with @After annotation will run after each test method.
	4. @BeforeClass - methods with @Before class annotation will run in the start of execution.
	5. @AfterClass - methods with @AfterClass annotation will run after all the test cases have been executed.
	6. @Ignore - methods with @Ignore are used to ignore a test case.
